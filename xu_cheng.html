<h1>Hello, I am Xu Cheng</h1>
<p>I am a product enthusiast who enjoys finding a balance between user experience and business goals.</p>



<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Xu - Sounds like the opposite of UX, but I believe that it means I can see user experience from a different perspective. ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Currently, I am a grad student at UC Berkeley studying Information Management & Systems and previously graduated from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Cognitive Science, specialized in Human-Computer Interaction. I have professional experience from TikTok, Logitech, data.ai, and MioTech, and my product experience spans eCommerce, CRM, FinTech, and Community-based Marketplace.</p>
<p>Aside from work, I enjoy traveling, cooking, blogging, exploring new coffee shops, seeking outdoor adventures, and checking out some kittens pics. If you want to discuss about my projects or just want to chat, feel free to get in touch! </p>
